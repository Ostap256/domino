                  The most popular type of play are layout games, which fall into two main categories, blocking games and scoring games.
                  Most domino games are blocking games, i.e. the objective is to empty one's hand while blocking the opponent's. In the end, a score may be determined by counting the pips in the losing players' hands.
                  In scoring games the scoring is different and happens mostly during game play, making it the principal objective."
